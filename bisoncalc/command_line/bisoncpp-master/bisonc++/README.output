Output to the xxx.output file by the --verbose or --construction flags are
mostly handled from the State::allStates() function. This function calls
State's operator<<, which is initialized by a pointer pointing to either

        insertStd, 
        insertExt 

or 

        skipInsertion.

Inspect state/insertstd.cc for the standard insertion method and
state/insertext.cc for the extensive insertion method.
