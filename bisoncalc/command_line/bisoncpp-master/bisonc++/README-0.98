Bisonc++ 0.98 is a complete rewrite of the well-known bison(++) parser
generator. See the manual page for details.

Several demo programs are found below the bisonc++/documentation/examples
directory. In that directory there's a README file describing the purposes of
the various examples.

The (original) bison documentation is provided in html format in the directory
bisonc++/documentation/html. The Debian package (bisonc++*.deb) installs that
documentation below /usr/share/doc/bisonc++. 

Note that bisonc++'s specifications differs from bison's specifications, in
particular with respect to the declaration section. The production rule
specification section is, however, practically identical to the one defined
for bison. There are some differences, though. Consult bisonc++'s manpage
(installed by the Debian package, otherwise available in the directory
bisonc++/documentation/man) for the differences.

Since it is a complete rewrite it is quite likely that bugs will be
encountered. Bison itself offers an extensive input grammar, and I may easily
have overlooked various subtleties. 

Do not hesitate to contact me when you encounter a bug. A (small) grammar
illustrating your point is then always extremely useful.
