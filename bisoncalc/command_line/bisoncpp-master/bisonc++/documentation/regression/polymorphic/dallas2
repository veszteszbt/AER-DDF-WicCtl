Frank,

I've narrowed things down to one particular rule.  It seems that the
following rule with all of its alternatives is causing problems.

scoped_identifier:
   TOK_IDENTIFIER 
   {
   }
|
   TOK_SCOPE_OPERATOR TOK_IDENTIFIER
   {
   }
|
   scoped_identifier TOK_SCOPE_OPERATOR TOK_IDENTIFIER
   {
   }
;

If I simplify this rule to the following, I do not have any problems
with semantic values not being saved on the stack correctly.

scoped_identifier:
   TOK_IDENTIFIER 
   {
   }
;

It seems that these extra alternatives are confusing the parser.  Do you
have any idea why this could be?

Thanks,

Dallas
