This is the original example resulting from a discussion I had with 
Dallas A. Clement about polymorphic semantic values. The program creates a
simple parser that can be run as follows:
    demo < input
When run as 
    demo x < input
debug output is shown, including selected semantic values on the semantic
value stack.
