This exampe features a grammar showing both S/R and R/R conflicts.

The grammar produces 4 shift-reduce conflicts and 3 reduce-reduce conflicts.

By default, the S/R conflicts are solved using SHIFT, while the R/R conflicts
are solved using a reduction to the rule first mentioned in the grammar.

Notes on the output generated by bison. 

Bison states:

    grammar:7.5: warning: rule never reduced because of conflicts: E: i

However, this is probably incorrect considering its own documentation which
states the `first rule' preference in case of R/R conflicts.

Here is the grammar used in this example:

    %token i
    
    %%
    
    E: 
        i
    |
        i
    |
        E '+' E
    |
        E '*' E
    ;
