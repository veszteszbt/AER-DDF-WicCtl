// The FIRST element of SR arrays shown below uses `d_type', defining the
// state's type, and `d_lastIdx' containing the last element's index. If
// d_lastIdx contains the REQ_TOKEN bitflag (see below) then the state needs
// a token: if in this state d_token is Reserved__::UNDETERMINED__, nextToken() will be
// called

// The LAST element of SR arrays uses `d_token' containing the last retrieved
// token to speed up the (linear) seach.  Except for the first element of SR
// arrays, the field `d_action' is used to determine what to do next. If
// positive, it represents the next state (used with SHIFT); if zero, it
// indicates `ACCEPT', if negative, -d_action represents the number of the
// rule to reduce to.

// `lookup()' tries to find d_token in the current SR array. If it fails, and
// there is no default reduction UNEXPECTED_TOKEN__ is thrown, which is then
// caught by the error-recovery function.

// The error-recovery function will pop elements off the stack until a state
// having bit flag ERR_ITEM is found. This state has a transition on errTok__
// which is applied. In this errTok__ state, while the current token is not a
// proper continuation, new tokens are obtained by nextToken(). If such a
// token is found, error recovery is successful and the token is
// handled according to the error state's SR table and parsing continues.
// During error recovery semantic actions are ignored.

// A state flagged with the DEF_RED flag will perform a default
// reduction if no other continuations are available for the current token.

// The ACCEPT STATE never shows a default reduction: when it is reached the
// parser returns ACCEPT(). During the grammar
// analysis phase a default reduction may have been defined, but it is
// removed during the state-definition phase.

// So:
//      s_x[] = 
//      {
//                  [_field_1_]         [_field_2_]
//
// First element:   {state-type,        idx of last element},
// Other elements:  {required token,    action to perform},
//                                      ( < 0: reduce, 
//                                          0: ACCEPT,
//                                        > 0: next state)
//      }
