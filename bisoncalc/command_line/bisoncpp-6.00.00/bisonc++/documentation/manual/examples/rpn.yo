The first example is about a simple double-precision reverse polish notation
calculator (a calculator using postfix operators). This example provides a
good starting point, since operator precedence is not an issue. The second
example illustrates how operator precedence is handled.

All sources for this calculator are found in the lurl(examples/rpn/)
