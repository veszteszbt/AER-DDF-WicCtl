Most examples available before version 1.00 are now in the ../regression
directory, where they are most easily used by runnning the `run' script.

This directory is kept for historical reasons only.

bison++Example.NEW: The original example provided by Alain Coetmeur.

        compile by running `make'
        The program can be run by having it read test.txt or test2.txt from
        its stdin.
        It has no other purpose (as far as I can see).
