This grammar was submitted by Ramanand Mandayam on July 5, 2010. The grammar
generates 2 shift/reduce conflicts resulting from forced removal of shiftable
items (in State 2), favoring reductions. Also it uses (production rule)
priorities (in state 11) to remove shiftable items in favor of reductions. The
grammar is interesting in that it shows that a grammar may (by default) reduce
rather than shift. See also section 'Rule Precedence' in Bisonc++'s manual.
