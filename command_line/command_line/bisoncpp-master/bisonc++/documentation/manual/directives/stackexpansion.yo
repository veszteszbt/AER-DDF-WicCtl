Syntax: bf(%stack-expansion) tt(size)

Defines the number of elements to be added to the generated parser's semantic
value stack when it must be enlarged. By default 10 elements are added to the
stack. This option/directive is interpreted only once, and only if tt(size) at
least equals the default stack expansion size of 10.
