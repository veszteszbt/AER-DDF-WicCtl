Syntax: bf(%locationstruct) tt(struct-definition) 

Defines the organization of the location-struct data type bf(LTYPE__). This
struct should be specified analogously to the way the parser's stacktype is
defined using bf(%union) (see below). The location struct type is named
bf(LTYPE__). If neither bf(locationstruct) nor bf(LTYPE__) is specified, the
default link(LTYPE__)(LSPNEEDED) struct is used.
