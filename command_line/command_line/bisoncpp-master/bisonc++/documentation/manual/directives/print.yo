Syntax: bf(%print-tokens) 

    The tt(%print-tokens) directive provides an implementation of the Parser
class's tt(print__) function displaying the current token value and the text
matched by the lexical scanner as received by the generated tt(parse)
function.

    The tt(print__) function is also implemented if the tt(--print)
command-line option is provided.
